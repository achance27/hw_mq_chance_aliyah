## Comments

I was refreshed by this week's lessons on positioning, as usually I run through trial and error to find if I forget how each positing element exactly work. For media queries I rarely combine both min-width and max-width so it was nice to remember that. I also don't use max-width often since I do mobile first now so it was good to practice with those.
